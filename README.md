# Langchain_Openai_chatbot

In my project, I created an AI-powered chatbot for an educational institution that provides data science training, specifically for their Discord support server. 
This chatbot will only respond to relevant keywords and uses OpenAI's Chat GPT 3.5 Turbo. For the chat history feature, I utilized the "conversationbuffermemory" from the Langchain library.

In this repository, I did not share the main.py, gitignore, and env. files.
